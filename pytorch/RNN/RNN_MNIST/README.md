# Overview
Build a simple Recurrent neural network in PyTorch and train it to classify (recognize) handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset

# MNIST dataset
* A database of handwritten digits from 0 to 9
* Containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
* The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker
